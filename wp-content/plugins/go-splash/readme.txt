= limitations ? =
go splash hooks in to the WordPress WP hook. Any specialty theme that hooks in prior to this hook and somehow hijacks the screen output will bypass this plugin.
While any theme that adheres to WP convention will not pose a problem, there may be some themes you might want to check prior to going PREMIUM.

== Installation ==
install and activate the plugin. you will find the admin menu in go splash admin section.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work with every theme ? = 
Probably not. This plugin ties in to the WP hook so anything that intercepts the screen before the WP hook will override the splash-screen.
All standard themes should work fine though.

none (yet)
